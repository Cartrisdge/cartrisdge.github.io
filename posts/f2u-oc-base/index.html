-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=f2u-base-4-by-silhh-on-deviantart>F2U BASE 4 By Silhh On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#f2u-base-4-by-silhh-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://t00.deviantart.net/shgzOc__8nmz_lVNkR7fxVDpJck=/300x200/filters:fixed_height(100,100):origin()/pre00/44e9/th/pre/i/2015/167/d/0/_f2u__free_to_use_base_by_toneru_chan-d8wj61u.png" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.reoqEv06L6zcBoVufA7hwgAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="F2U BASE 4 by Silhh on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: silhh.deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>f2u.</p></blockquote><p>The History of Anime: From Manga to Animation
